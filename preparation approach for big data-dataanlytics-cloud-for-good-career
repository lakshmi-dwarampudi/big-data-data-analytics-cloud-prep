   people who wants serious preparation on cutting edge technologies here are my pointers.... you need solid 3 months to 1 year preparations in a planned approach
   
   prepare DS algorithms, any one coding language and practice well before going to any other preparations
   
   most important is string manipulations, searching,sorting,trees, dynamic programming and graph theory alogorithms are most important if you would like to target for tire one companies
   
   Here is my sincere suggestions
   
   1. kick of your lazyness
   2. Don't freakout any technology and content, just focus on approach to learn and practice well
   3. when you start doing coding and problem resolving don't worry even if you are not able to resolve single problem
     
      a. just imporove reading and understanding skills 
              Read the problem and try to understand it, try to put logic on a paper and think multiple purmitations and combinations
              Then Go through the solutions and impliment it.
              again do the same in different different timings randomly pick already practiced questions and minimize the time of reading understanding and implementing
              most important thing was maintain a repository in Github where you praticed questions, logics, implementations
              it will helps you alot in documenting properly organizing and to reffer quickly
      b. most most important thing was plz don't quit your self by seeing 10 or 20 problems if they are taking time initially or you are not able to understand it correctly.... just do practice for minimum 1 month then you will see the difference in your thinking and approach
      
       just think you should be in the shoes of problem resolver, the more problems you face the more you learn and you will improve your skills to resolve the problems
       initial it is very difficult but if u know the fact upfront, you will develop interest while you keep on solving the questions, trust me your thinking capabilities will improve alot, you just need dedication, focus, practice and continuous learning.
   4. most most important thing... don't restrict yourself and your abilities.... human mind having exceptional learning capabilities if we train our brain systematically.
      Don't miss any entertainment and enjoyments in your life. just love yourself put the efforts. don't underestimate yourself and others capabilities, be with positive mindset even in worst situations surely you will shine... only thing is don't loose continuity. 
      if you get a chance to learn collaboratively it's dam good, as you will appreciate each other while doing the things, it will boost your confidence 10 times  
   5. Be safe and responsble and take care of beloved one in this pandemic situations and get in touch with each other on regular basis... just maintain human network of friends and professionals.
   6. lastly i will share simple thing if you have right skills nothing is difficult, just improve your skills and abilities age, gender, race doesn't matter. support and help people arround you to improve their skills and abilities so that together you will grow.collaborative growth is always healthy.... don't be narrow minded. just be out spoken proactive in learning things.
   
   if you improve your skills automatically money will flow into you in this knowledge based industry. 
   
   you can reach me you if you need any help in guidance, i will also prepare git hub repo and will share it in future
   
   if you need any datasets to work on python u can visit kaggle is the best resouce
   
   if possible participate in hackathons or summits....
